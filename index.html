            <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

                It is used for:
            <ul>
                <li>web development (server-side),</li>
                <li>software development,</li>
                <li>mathematics,</li>
                <li>system scripting.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
                <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
                <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other
                    programming languages.</li>
                <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.
                    This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
                <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>

            <header>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</header>
            <ul>
                <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with
                    influence from mathematics.</li>
                <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often
                    use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
                <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops,
                    functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>
            </ul>
            <code>
                print("Hello, World!")
            </code>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Indentation">
            <header>Python Indentation</header>
            <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

                Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in
                Python is very important.

                Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
                Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</p>
            <code>
                if 5 > 2:
                print("Five is greater than two!")
            </code>
            <p>The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.You have to use the same
                number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Variables">
            <header>Python Variables</header>
            <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:</p>
            <code>
                x = 5
                y = "Hello, World!"
            </code>
            <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Comments">
            <header>Python Comments</header>
            <p>Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

                Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:</p>
            <code>
                #This is a comment.
                print("Hello, World!")
            </code>
            <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.

                Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

                Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
            <p>Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:</p>
            <code>
                print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Multi_Line_Comments">
            <header>Multi Line Comments</header>
            <p>Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
                Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline
                string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
            </p>
            <code>
                """
                This is a comment
                written in
                more than just one line
                """
                print("Hello, World!")
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Data_Types">
            <header>Python Data Types</header>
            <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.

                Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

                Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories: <br>
                Text Type: str <br>
                Numeric Types: int, float, complex <br>
                Sequence Types: list, tuple, range <br>
                Mapping Type: dict <br>
                Set Types: set, frozenset <br>
                Boolean Type: bool <br>
                Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview <br>
            </p>
            <code>
                x = 5
                y = "Hello, World!"
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Numbers">
            <header>Python Numbers</header>
            <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>int</li>
                <li>float</li>
                <li>complex</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
            <code>
                x = 1    # int
                y = 2.8  # float
                z = 1j   # complex\
            </code>
